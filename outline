analog voltmeter across battery?


}


statup{

find orientation
test wheels and brakes?



present user with choices of programs
  find moment of inertia
  flip cube in "circle" 
  balance cube on edge

}

moment_of_inertia{

  1) have user tilt cube up to certain angle on one axis
    a) prompted by UI via bluetooth
  2) have user drop cube
  3) have cube use accel/gyro to sense when cube is dropped
  4) use onboard timers to get precise measurment of time
  5) repeat as needed on all axis to calculate 
  
}


flip_cube_in_circle{

spin up individual wheels and brake them causing the cube to flip over each face one at a time

}


balance_cube_on_edge{


//this is the hard one//


}
